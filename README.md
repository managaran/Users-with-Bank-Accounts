# Users-with-Bank-Accounts

Update your existing User class to have an association with the BankAccount class. You should not have to change anything in the BankAccount class. 

For example, from the User class we should be able to deposit money into the user's account:

class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.account = BankAccount(int_rate=0.02, balance=0)
    
    # other methods
    
    def make_deposit(self, amount):
    	# your code here
copy
But our User class does not have a self.account_balance attribute. What it does have is an instance of a BankAccount by the name of self.account. That means that we'll be mirroring the methods created in the BankAccount class like make_deposit (and other methods referencing self.account_balance). But we'll be calling on the  BankAccount class to do most of the work! That's the goal of this assignment, and you may find that you do not have to add much logic if any. 

Remember in our User methods, we can now access the BankAccount class through our self.account attribute, like so:

class User:
    def example_method(self):
        self.account.deposit(100)		# we can call the BankAccount instance's methods
    	print(self.account.balance)		# or access its attributes
copy
Example Display for Sensei bonus

Update the User class __init__ method

Add a make_deposit method to the User class that calls on it's bank account's instance methods.

Add a make_withdrawal method to the User class that calls on it's bank account's instance methods.

Add a display_user_balance method to the User class that displays user's account balance

SENSEI BONUS: Allow a user to have multiple accounts; update methods so the user has to specify which account they are withdrawing or depositing to

SENPAI BONUS: Add a transfer_money(self, amount, other_user) method to the user class that takes an amount and a different User instance, and transfers money from the user's account into another user's account.
